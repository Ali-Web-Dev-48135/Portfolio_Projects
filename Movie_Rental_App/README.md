I built this movie rental for practice and fun. I used redux toolkit to manage the movie cart state.
This was fun for to work on as I learned alot about redux in react. Please feel free to download and run the project for learning purposes.
Reach out to me if you need any help or would like to work together on a react project.
This has logic for adding a movie to the cart, increasing the quantity , removing movies and the amount updates smartly.
